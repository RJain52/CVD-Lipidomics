*UPDATE 12/24/2022*

-Code related to analysis of <a href="show.wisc.edu">SHOW</a> data has been posted, along with the de-identfied working dataset and expected outputs. The information is in a Quarto document with an associated .html rendering for viewing in browsers. These files are in the 'SHOW_analysis' folder.

-Code related renaming lipid names from MIDUS (generated by Metabolon using the Sciex Lipidyzer platform) was previously uploaded. A file with original lipid names and code to rename the data and split into individual lipid species and class sum data is included in a Quarto document.

All lipidomics data from the MIDUS study must be requested by contacting the <a href="midus.wisc.edu">MIDUS</a> study administrators.
Any data presented here was randomly generated - it is NOT the data used in our analyses.
